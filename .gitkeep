# Placeholder file to keep the checkpoints directory in git
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Place your trained model checkpoint (.pth or .pt file) in this directory.
# The checkpoint should contain the model state dict.
#
# Example checkpoint formats supported:
# - {'model_state_dict': {...}, 'epoch': X, 'loss': Y}
# - {'state_dict': {...}}
# - Raw state_dict: {...}
#
# Note: Large checkpoint files should be managed with Git LFS or uploaded
# manually to your deployment platform.
